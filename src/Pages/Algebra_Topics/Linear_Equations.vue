      <h1>Linear Equations</h1>
      <h2>What are Linear Equations?</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          Equations are Mathematical Statements that contain an '=' sign. Linear Equations are equations that describe a line.<br>
          Linear equations can have either 1 or 2 variables. A variable is a value that is represented by a letter and its called a variable because it can vary in value.<br>
          In an equation there can be two types of variables: <span>independent variables</span> and <span>Dependent variables</span> 
          Linear equations are distinguised because theyre variables can only have an exponent of  1. 
        </p>
        <h4>Dependent Variables </h4>
        <p>Dependent variable are values that depend on another variable. In linear equations they are usually denoted as the Y variable.</p>
        <p>if using <b>function</b> notation then the <b>Dependent Variable</b> is denoted as <b>f(x)</b>  </p>
        <h2>
          Standard Form
        </h2>
        <p>
          An equation can be written in different ways called forms,so there could be different equations that represent the same line. <br>
          The standard form for linear equations of 1 variable are in the form <span>ax+b=0</span> <br>

          A linear equation with 2 variables has a standard form of <span>ax+by+c=0</span>
        </p>
      <h2>Slope Intercept Form </h2>
       <p>
         Another one of the forms used to describe a line is the <b>point slope </b>form.<br> 
         This form gives us 2 important bits of information. First of all it gives us the value of the slope,
         and secondly it gives us the value of the Y intercept. <br>
       </p>
       <h3>whats the slope ? </h3>
       <p>The best way to define the slope is to think about it as the ratio <b>rise</b>/<b>run</b></p>
       <p>The slope is the type of slant that the line has , we can calculate the value by taking a 2 points in the graph of the line and </p>
        <p>comparing the y value of each point and the x value of each point.  </p>
